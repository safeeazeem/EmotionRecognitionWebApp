# EmotionRecognitionWebApp

This WebApp was made in Flask for my Thesis project. In this project I trained an LSTM and a CNN model on social media data that was scraped of twitter. 

The model was trained to classify 4 Emotions
1. Anger
2. Fear
3. Happiness
4. Sadness 

The models were trained on 300 epochs and the results were as follows.
